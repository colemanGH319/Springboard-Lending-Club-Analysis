# Springboard-Lending-Club-Analysis
Capstone project for Springboard's Intro to Data Science course

This repository contains my capstone project for Springboard's Intro to Data Science course (previously called Foundations of Data Science). For this project, I chose to analyze personal loans issued through Lending Club in the years 2014 and 2015 and determine the factors that impacted whether or not a loan would successfully be repaid. Additionally, an investment strategy was developed after taking into account the risk of defaulting.

NOTE: The final report is saved in a Word document (Final Report.docx). The slide deck is a PowerPoint (Lending Club.pptx).
